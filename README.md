Venmo is a peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile payment app owned by PayPal. The Venmo app allows its users to exchange money with just a click of a button. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Venmoâ€™s net payment volume amounted to 29 billion U.S. dollars, representing a 56 percent year-on-year growth, and its user-base had more than 40 million active accounts .
